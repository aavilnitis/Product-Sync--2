# Product Stock Count Sync

Custom plugin for a Woocommerce shop gatavodaba.lv

Plugin works by assigning function that copies product stock count from a live XML file into the Woocommerce store to a template. The template can be assigned to a page, which will run the function every time the page is accessed.

Plugin runs once every 12h synchronising the stock levels of both shops to avoid supply issues. It also outputs the synchronisation results in a table that is displayed in the page the template is assigned to.

Plugin developed to turn the woocommerce shop into a dropshipping store that forwards orders to the supplier.
